# IC-tester-Using-Embedded-C
This project uses Atmega16A to test 6 different ICs using Codevision C program for the AVR microcontroller. Those ICs are 7430, 7432, 7433 7434, 7437, and 7438. The aim is to perform different tests on the IC in order to print out the name of the IC that is currently being tested. This is done using Serial Communications with the PC using TTL. If there is no IC, the terminal should print “Empty”.

ICS Description: <br>
7430: NAND <br>
7432: OR <br>
7434: NOR (Open Collector) <br>
7434: Buffer <br>
7437: NAND <br>
7438: NAND (Open Collector) <br>
